Build Environment for Debian Based Packages (Ubuntu and Debian)
===============================================================

This is a template that contains all the dependencies for building software using `./build-in-docker.sh` from [development/bootstrap-build-environment](https://mrw.sh/development/bootstrap-build-environment). This speeds up the builds.

Tha `master` branch is  not used, but the specific branches, such as `i386-bionic` to build for ubuntu bionic on i386 hardware.
